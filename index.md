title: Example Models
---

The [mois-examples](https://github.com/edinburgh-rbm/mois-examples)
repository on Github contains, unsurprisingly, examples of models
implemented using the [mois](/mois) software. These pages contain
fuller information and [explanations of these models and sample
output](#example-models).

In general a model file needs to implement the model itself as
well as a class derived from `MoisMain` which serves to act as
an entry point for the simulation and sets up some default 
initial conditions.
