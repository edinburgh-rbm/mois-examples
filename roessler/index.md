The Rössler Attractor
=====================

A [Rössler attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6ssler_attractor)
is generated by the following system of differential equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= -y - z
\frac{dy}{dt} &= x + ay
\frac{dz}{dt} &= b + z(x - c)
y_{n+1} &= bx_n
\end{aligned}
$$

It is a simple example of the use of the *OrdinaryProcess* class and
is implemented in the
[Roessler.scala](https://github.com/edinburgh-rbm/mois-examples/blob/master/src/main/scala/uk/ac/ed/inf/mois/examples/Roessler.scala)
file as follows just like this:

{% highlight scala %}
import uk.ac.ed.inf.mois.MoisMain
import uk.ac.ed.inf.mois.OrdinaryProcess

case class Roessler(a: Double, b: Double, c: Double) extends OrdinaryProcess("Henon") {
  val x = Double("ex:x")
  val y = Double("ex:y")
  val z = Double("ex:z")
  d(x) := -y - z
  d(y) := x + a*y
  d(z) := b + z * (x - c)
}

object RoesslerModel extends MoisMain("Roessler Model") {
  val model = new Roessler(0.2, 0.2, 5.7)
}
{% endhighlight %}

The $d(x)$ operator, which may also be written as $d(x)/dt$ denotes
the time derivative of $x$ with respect to $t$ as might be supposed.

Running the model for 1000 time steps and graphing the output with
gnuplot produces:
